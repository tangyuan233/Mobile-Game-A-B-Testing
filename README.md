# Mobile Game A/B Testing
Cookie Cats is a mobile puzzle game, a classic 'connect three' style puzzle game where palyer must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. As a players progress throught the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make in-app purchase. In addition to driving in-app purchase, these gates also give players an enforced break from playing the game, therefore increase and prolong player's enjoryment.

Where should the gates be placed become important. Initially the first gate was placed at level 30, in this A/B testing we move gate to level 40, and look at the impact on player retention.
